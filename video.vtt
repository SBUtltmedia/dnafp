00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:02.816
Now you know all about Electro placement and Lead

2
00:00:03.328 --> 00:00:04.352
So what does it all mean

3
00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:08.448
The ECG machine record electrical activity using the following convention

4
00:00:09.472 --> 00:00:11.008
Electrical activity moving towards

5
00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:14.080
What's the positive end of the electron is shown as an upward deflection

6
00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:15.360
Can on the ECG lead

7
00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:20.992
Electrical forces moving away from the positive end of the electrode is shown as a downward deflection

8
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.904
Electrical force moving perpendicular to the electrode will have biphasic isoelectric deflection or maybe note

9
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.672
Deflection

10
00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:34.304
Electrical forces moving exactly parallel to electrode will have the greatest amplitude

11
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.888
I'll go straight this using lead one only

12
00:00:38.656 --> 00:00:41.472
Remember this lead goes from the right arm towards the left on

13
00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:45.312
If the electrical forces are moving towards the patient's left

14
00:00:45.568 --> 00:00:48.128
Parallel and towards a positive end of the electrode

15
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.176
MLB large upward deflection

16
00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:56.064
If the electrical forces are moving towards the patient's left but not exactly parallel to the lead

17
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.136
They will be an upper deflection but it will be of lesser magnitude

18
00:01:00.672 --> 00:01:03.488
If the electrical forces are moving away from the positive end

19
00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:06.304
Or towards the right arm in the case of Lead 1

20
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.584
10 reflection

21
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.608
Will be downward

22
00:01:09.376 --> 00:01:15.520
And finally if the electrical forces are moving perpendicular to the positive end of the electrode so just straight downward in the case of Li

23
00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:19.104
The net will be an isoelectric deflection or notify

24
00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:26.528
By comparing deflection in all 12 lead shown on an ECG you can determine exactly which direction impulses travel

25
00:01:26.784 --> 00:01:27.808
Bubbling at any given moment

26
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.392
I want to make sure the defections are clear

27
00:01:32.928 --> 00:01:38.048
Since the forces are moving inferiorly they're traveling towards the positive ends of the inferior leads

28
00:01:38.304 --> 00:01:39.328
2 3 and avf

29
00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:42.144
Different show up as positive

30
00:01:43.168 --> 00:01:48.288
In a normal Rhythm depolarization begins and SA node at the Superior part of the right atrium

31
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.360
And spreads downwards during atrial depolarization

32
00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:57.504
Therefore during normal atrial depolarization the inferior leads should show positive deflections

33
00:01:58.528 --> 00:02:01.088
This is a fundamental concept that will come again soon

34
00:02:03.904 --> 00:02:06.208
Now it's time to learn the major deflections of an ECG

35
00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:10.816
First comes a P wave which represents atrial depolarization

36
00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:15.424
As I already showed depolarization translates to physical contraction

37
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.216
Do calcium dependent calcium release

38
00:02:17.728 --> 00:02:18.240
However

39
00:02:18.496 --> 00:02:22.080
By convention ECGs don't show contraction they show depolarization

40
00:02:22.848 --> 00:02:26.944
You can only actually visualize contraction through Imaging such as an echocardiogram

41
00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:32.064
It may be semantics and many people don't stick this convention but I feel it is important distinction

42
00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:38.464
Do the conduction delay at the AV node the tracing returns to Baseline after the P wave

43
00:02:39.488 --> 00:02:41.024
Next to see the QRS complex

44
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.328
Which is when the ventricles are depolarizing

45
00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:46.656
The tracing returns to Baseline again after us

46
00:02:47.168 --> 00:02:52.288
And lastly you see the T wave which represents the repolarization or relaxation of the ventricles

47
00:02:53.312 --> 00:02:55.360
Atrial repolarization is not seen

48
00:02:55.616 --> 00:02:57.408
Because it is hidden within the QRS complex

49
00:02:57.664 --> 00:03:00.224
Since the Atria are relaxing while the ventricles are Contracting

50
00:03:02.528 --> 00:03:04.064
Let's break down the QRS complex

51
00:03:05.088 --> 00:03:07.392
Any initial downward deflection is a Q wave

52
00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:10.976
The first up or deflection is called in our way

53
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.840
Any downward deflection pass Baseline after an R wave is an s-wave

54
00:03:16.864 --> 00:03:20.960
Any subsequent up or deflection after an S Wave is called in our Prime wave

55
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.520
Manicurist complexes

56
00:03:23.776 --> 00:03:25.312
Have an initial deflection that is up for

57
00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:26.592
Enough do not have

58
00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:29.408
There many different QRS patterns

59
00:03:30.688 --> 00:03:34.784
Who you have a normal QRS where the initial deflection is downward the Q wave

60
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.928
Then there's a positive deflection the r-wave and then finally another down or deflection path Baseline the S Wave

61
00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:43.744
You can also have an R wave

62
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.560
Which is simply an upward deflection that returns to Baseline

63
00:03:47.328 --> 00:03:52.192
Notice that there are no downward deflections below Baseline so there are no Q or S waves

64
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.008
There's also the Q waves

65
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.848
Which is an initial downward deflection that returns to Baseline

66
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.200
I would call this a Q wave but some people call this a q s Wave by convention

67
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.088
You can also have this wave which shows an initial up or deflection the r-wave

68
00:04:09.344 --> 00:04:11.392
Dennett downward deflection pass Baseline

69
00:04:11.648 --> 00:04:12.160
The S Wave

70
00:04:12.416 --> 00:04:16.000
And finally another up or deflection past Baseline the are PrimeWay

71
00:04:16.768 --> 00:04:19.839
Therefore this is called an rsr Prime pattern

72
00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:21.887
All transferred to as bunny ears

73
00:04:22.911 --> 00:04:29.055
Of course ventricular depolarization follows the conduction pathway that we described earlier including the right and left bundle branches

74
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:31.615
Kendra sells and the ventricular myocytes themselves

75
00:04:32.127 --> 00:04:35.455
But ECGs don't show the depolarization of single my sides

76
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:38.527
They show the overall depolarization in a given Direction

77
00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:44.671
To make this clear the following explanation is talking about the average impulsive actor at a given point in time

78
00:04:46.975 --> 00:04:50.559
Keeping this in mind you should know that these varying QRS patterns exist

79
00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:54.143
Because of ventricular depolarization does not occur in Only One Direction

80
00:04:54.655 --> 00:04:58.239
If example the ventricles were simply activated from right to left

81
00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:03.871
Then the Cure us would simply look like a tall R wave as the impulse travels towards the left lateral leads

82
00:05:04.127 --> 00:05:06.687
Such as v v v 6-1 and AVL

83
00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:07.711
A daddy

84
00:05:07.967 --> 00:05:08.479
Q wave

85
00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:11.551
In a VR as the impulse travels away from the right

86
00:05:12.831 --> 00:05:14.879
Unfortunately it's a little more complicated than that

87
00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:20.511
Instead ventricular depolarization begins in the left side of the interventricular septum

88
00:05:20.767 --> 00:05:22.815
And then spreads downward and rightward

89
00:05:23.071 --> 00:05:24.095
Towards the right ventricle

90
00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:30.751
When the right and left ventricles are depolarizing the left ventricle Dominic because because it has much thicker myocardium

91
00:05:31.775 --> 00:05:34.847
Does the overall electrical forces swing towards the left

92
00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:39.711
Once the entire myocardium is depolarized there is no longer any potential difference

93
00:05:40.223 --> 00:05:42.271
So they were tracing returns to Baseline

94
00:05:44.063 --> 00:05:47.647
Aloha Street this using lead one which again goes from the right arm to the left arm

95
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:54.815
As the interventricular septum depolarizes from left to right the impulse is moving away from the left arm which shows a small

96
00:05:55.071 --> 00:05:55.839
All downward deflection

97
00:05:56.863 --> 00:06:01.215
As the overall impulse swings back the left it is now moving towards the positive electrode

98
00:06:01.471 --> 00:06:03.519
So you see a strong positive deflection

99
00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:08.127
Then the tracing return to Baseline once depolarization is complete

100
00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.687
You can see this forms a QR wave

101
00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.039
Nothing about what this would look like for lead 3

102
00:06:15.807 --> 00:06:17.343
Li 3 is an inferior lead

103
00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:22.975
An initial downward in right word impulse should be directed exactly towards the positive electrode for lead 3

104
00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:25.535
This should appear as positive deflection

105
00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:29.375
As overall forces continued downward and to the left

106
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:33.727
It is traveling roughly perpendicular to the lead so they're chasing returns to Baseline

107
00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:37.311
And as the impulse travels towards the left lateral Direction

108
00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:41.151
It is traveling away from the positive electrode so there should be a negative deflection

109
00:06:42.431 --> 00:06:44.479
You should recognize that this is an RS weight

110
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:45.503
So

111
00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:51.903
You can see that the exact same impulse shows up differently in different leads because each lead has a different perspective of the same in

112
00:06:54.207 --> 00:06:57.791
Now we have to consider the same concept in the transverse plane of the chest leads

113
00:06:58.815 --> 00:07:02.143
It's important to remember that the right ventricle is anterior to the left ventricle

114
00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:07.775
Does Ozzy impulse initially travels from the left side of the interventricular septum towards the right ventricle

115
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:11.103
The vent the vector points both right word and anteriorly

116
00:07:12.127 --> 00:07:12.639
This will be

117
00:07:12.895 --> 00:07:14.175
Towards lead V1

118
00:07:14.431 --> 00:07:15.711
Show me the POS of deflection

119
00:07:15.967 --> 00:07:18.527
And away from lead V6 shown as a negative

120
00:07:19.807 --> 00:07:23.135
As the impulse swings back the left ventricle the vector points

121
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:24.927
Leftward and posterior Li

122
00:07:25.951 --> 00:07:31.071
This is a way from V1 show me the negative deflection and towards V6 shown as a positive deflection

123
00:07:32.095 --> 00:07:36.959
Pace V2 V3 V4 and V5 show the intermediate stages as the r-wave

124
00:07:37.215 --> 00:07:37.983
Grow taller

125
00:07:38.495 --> 00:07:40.031
This is turn our way for Crush

126
00:07:41.311 --> 00:07:45.919
The lead in which the height of the r-wave becomes a greater magnitude than the depth of the S Wave

127
00:07:46.175 --> 00:07:47.455
It's called the transition

128
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:50.015
Which is usually lead V3 or V4

129
00:07:50.783 --> 00:07:55.903
I think the best way to explain this is simply that the main Vector during ventricular depolarization is to the left

130
00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:58.463
Does the thick of my aquarium in the left ventricle

131
00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:02.047
Does the further left the lead is the higher the r-wave should be

132
00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:07.423
These examples show why QRS complexes have different patterns

133
00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:09.215
Different leads in A Normal Heart

134
00:08:09.983 --> 00:08:12.543
I hope it is clear that within a single ECG

135
00:08:12.799 --> 00:08:14.591
Each lead can show different cross pattern

136
00:08:14.847 --> 00:08:17.663
Because each lead has a different perspective on the same impulse
